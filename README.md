## Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

I'm Santtu Pesonen, also known as MFG38 in some parts of the Internet. I'm a hobbyist musician, DOOM mapper and game developer hailing from Finland, with aspirations to become a programmer for the purposes of expanding my skill set and *maybe* becoming a software developer. Here on my GitHub page, you can find repositories for all of my programming misadventures, as well as my GZDoom mods. All repositories (almost all anyway) are publicly available and essentially document my progress as a programmer.

**Programming since**: Either 2009-ish or 2019 depending on whether working with game-specific scripting languages counts

**Particular interests**: Computer graphics, game development, software development

**Known programming languages**: Bash, Batch, C#, CSS, HTML, Python

**Text editor of choice**: Neovim, VSCodium

**Other things I like**: Beer, coffee, doing creative things, good food, music, scifi (esp. cyberpunk and space stuff), technology, video games
