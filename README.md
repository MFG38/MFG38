## Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

I'm Santtu Pesonen, also known as MFG38 in some parts of the Internet. I'm a hobbyist musician, DOOM mapper and game developer hailing from Finland, with aspirations to become a programmer for the purposes of expanding my skill set and *maybe* becoming a software developer. Here on my GitHub page, you can find repositories for all of my programming misadventures, as well as my GZDoom mods. All repositories are publicly available and essentially document my progress as a programmer.
